# pi-memory

`pi-memory` is being developed as a **context manager layer** for LLM agents: a system that helps control what is kept, retrieved, merged, and surfaced in the active context window over time.

While memory is one capability, the broader goal is reliable **context logistics** across long-running agent work.

Built as a [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) extension.

**Canonical spec (SSOT):** [Context Manager SSOT](docs/spec/context-manager-ssot.md)
