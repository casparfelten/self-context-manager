# Self Context Manager

Context management layer for LLM agents. Controls what is kept, retrieved, and surfaced in the active context window over time. Built as a [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) extension.

## Status

Working prototype. API validated against real XTDB. LLM-driven experiments show prompt policy meaningfully changes context management behaviour. See [experiments](docs/experiments/) for details.
